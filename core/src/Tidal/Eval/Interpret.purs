-- | **Mini-notation to patterns, as Haskell Tidal does it.**
-- |
-- | A port of `toPat`, `resolve_tpat`, `resolve_seq` and `resolve_size` from
-- | Tidal 1.10.1's `Sound.Tidal.ParseBP`, over the same AST. What it decides,
-- | and what the earlier interpreter got wrong (found by the GHCi oracle,
-- | `Test.OracleSpec`, 2026-10-01):
-- |
-- | - A sequence is a `timeCat` of its steps, each step weighted: `@r` and
-- |   `_` weight a step, `!n` repeats it n times. Both were ignored.
-- | - `<a b c>` and `{a b, c d e}` speed each sequence by the step rate over
-- |   its own step count, so `<a b c>` alternates rather than playing all
-- |   three in one cycle. The step rate defaults to the first sequence's.
-- | - Rates (`*`, `/`, `%`) and Euclidean arguments are patterns: a
-- |   constant is applied directly, anything else through `innerJoin`, as
-- |   Tidal's `patternify` does with and without a pure value.
-- | - `?` and `|` use Tidal's own randomness (`Tidal.Pattern.Random`),
-- |   offset by the parse-order seed, so they drop and choose what Tidal
-- |   drops and chooses.
-- | - `a .. b` enumerates as Tidal's `fromTo` does, per type.
